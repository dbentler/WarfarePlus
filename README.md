# Warfare+
A mod for Paradox Interactive's Victoria 3 - with the aim of making the (as of 12/17/2022) combat system more consistent and fun.

You can download the mod and play with it from the [Steam workshop here!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2902726598).

As for actual tweaks and adjustments:

### Battles & Fronts:
- Minimized the buffs that Attacking and Defending units received when the opposing side had superior combat stats.

This means that Great War Infantry actually has a vast visible improvement in offense compared to Skirmish/Line infantry, and techs like Gas Attack have a more visible impact on the battlefield. Generals also have a larger impact when it comes to going to war with a country at the same tech.

### Attackers:
- Attacker's minimum amount of attacking battalions have been increased from 33% to 50%
- Allowed Attackers to have the "Good visibility" combat condition.

### Defenders:
- Defense minimum amount of defending battalions has been increased from 50% to 55%
- Defense attrition has been decreased from 20% down to 15%.
- Defense unit's debuff for the battle condition "Poor visibility" has been decreased from -25% to -20%

### Quality of Life:
- The weight that an army chooses to advance to a province with a war goal or capital has been slightly increased from "10" to "14". This should mean you should see your armies actually try to make gains and accomplish your war goal tasks instead of having a picnic in the middle of nowhere.

### Generals:
Kidney stones offense and defense debuffs to morale have been decreased from -10% to -5%
Alcoholic generals, in addition to having a unit morale damage debuff of -10%, now have a unit offense buff of 5%.
